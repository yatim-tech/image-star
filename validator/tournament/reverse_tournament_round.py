"""
Script to reverse a tournament round by deleting it and setting the previous round back to active.

Usage:
    python reverse_tournament_round.py <tournament_id> <round_id_to_delete>

This script will:
1. Delete the specified round and all its associated data
2. Set the previous round to 'completed' status
3. Un-eliminate participants who were eliminated in the deleted round
4. Set tournament status back to 'active' if it was completed
5. Allow the tournament cycle to re-run the advancement logic

Example:
    python reverse_tournament_round.py tourn_f4eb788ad3d66f60_20250723 tourn_f4eb788ad3d66f60_20250723_round_002
